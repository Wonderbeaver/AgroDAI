Hello, my name is Duzenov Nurdaulet, and I am participating in the NASA Space Apps Hackathon. I'd like to introduce my project.

INSTRUCTIONS:
 1) Install all requirements. You can make it by writing "pip install -r requirements.txt"
 2) Open main.py and run it
 3) Go to the address "localhost:5000" or press the url you get in terminal
 4) Try out my project  :)




Please note that this is currently just a prototype, and I plan to continue developing it further. 
For now, I am using API keys from Meteomatics to retrieve the necessary data. Initially, I intended to use NASA's EARTHDATA, but I encountered some issues. 
I plan to integrate it later to enhance the project, and I hope thatâ€™s not a critical factor at the moment.

Regarding improvements, my goal is to enhance the functionality by providing users with more sophisticated data for better analysis.

At present, I have a machine learning model that predicts crop yield. However, in the future, I plan to make it more advanced. 
It will not only predict yield but also assess crop quality and calculate the vegetation index.

Additionally, I aim to improve the function that alerts users about potential floods or droughts. 
In the future, this feature will also include warnings about diseases and pests.
